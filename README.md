# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description:

This project is a React application that fetches data from an API to display information about planets and their residents. It consists of several components and styling files, as well as dependencies such as React Router DOM and Bootstrap.

### Components:

Planets Component (Planets.js):

Fetches data about planets from an external API.
Displays information about each planet, including its name, population, climate, and terrain.
Allows users to click on a planet card to view details about its residents.
Provides pagination functionality to navigate between pages of planet data.
Residents Component (Residents.js):

Fetches data about residents of a selected planet.
Displays information about each resident, including their name, height, mass, and gender.
Includes a back button to navigate back to the previous page.
Pagination Component (Pagination.js):

Provides pagination buttons for navigating between pages of planet data in the Planets component.

### Styling Files:

planets.css: Styles for the Planets component.
resident.css: Styles for the Residents component.
pagination.css: Styles for the Pagination component.

### Dependencies:

React Router DOM: Used for client-side routing to navigate between different components.
Bootstrap: Used for styling the components and making the application responsive.
Usage:

### Clone the repository.

Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the project using npm start.
